# Highly Charged Proteins and Their Repulsive Interactions Passively Antagonize Biomolecular Condensation

This repository is used to share core data and scripts for the publication of:
- Cheng Tan, Ai Niitsu, and Yuji Sugita (2022) Highly Charged Proteins and Their Repulsive Interactions Passively Antagonize Biomolecular Condensation. *bioRxiv* 10.1101/2022.11.16.516834


## Softwares

In this work we performed multiscale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using software GENESIS. It can be downloaded from its website and Github:
- [GENESIS website](https://www.r-ccs.riken.jp/labs/cbrt/genesis-version-2-0/)
- [GENESIS Github repository](https://github.com/genesis-release-r-ccs/genesis)

For data analysis, we wrote Julia and Python scripts based on a collection of tools shipped together with GENESIS:
- [GENESIS-CG-tool](https://github.com/genesis-release-r-ccs/genesis_cg_tool)


## Directory Structure

We put all the MD simulation files in the `simulation_files` directory.  With these files, one can reproduce all the results reported in the paper. MD trajectories are not included.
